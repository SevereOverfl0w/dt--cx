= Datomic->Crux Live converter

== Rationale

If you have a pre-existing system utilizing Datomic, it's a big requirement that you migrate in a single shot to another database.
Due to the similarity of Datomic & Crux, it may be possible to do a live sync of Datomic & Crux in order to make an incremental migration.

== Implemented

A live Datomic to Crux sync can happen for entities via REPL interactions.

== API

TBD

== Missing

* Bidirectional sync
* Tx time preservation
